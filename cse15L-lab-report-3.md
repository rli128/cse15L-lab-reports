# Find

The find command allows you to search through files and directories

## -name

The -name option allows you to search for a file with that name. This is especially useful for when you are searching for a specific extension (.txt, .java) In the example above, I used the find -name option to find all the files in the plos directory ending with 8.txt.

## -size

The -size option allows you to search for a file based on size. You can use the +size option to find a file that is bigger than the argument or -size to find a file smaller. For the example above, I used -size -3k to find files smaller than 3 kilobytes
